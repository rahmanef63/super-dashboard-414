# Feature Slice API Encapsulation Tracking

This document tracks the encapsulation of API routes and logic by feature slice in the codebase. The goal is to keep each feature (dashboard, workspace, menu, etc.) self-contained, modular, and easy to maintain.

## Structure Example

```
src/
  app/
    dashboard/
      api/
        route.ts         // Handles /dashboard/api
        workspaces/
          route.ts       // Handles /dashboard/api/workspaces
      layout.tsx
      page.tsx
    workspaces/
      api/
        route.ts         // Handles /workspaces/api
      layout.tsx
      page.tsx
    menu/
      api/
        route.ts         // Handles /menu/api
```

## Encapsulation Checklist

- [x] **Each feature has its own `api/` folder**
- [x] **API logic is colocated with feature code**
- [x] **No unnecessary files in each slice**
- [x] **Shared logic/types are imported from central `types` or `lib`**
- [ ] **Dynamic routes (e.g., `[id]`) are used for RESTful endpoints where needed**
- [ ] **Documentation/comments exist in each API handler**

---

## Tasks

- [ ] Refactor existing API routes to their respective feature slices
- [ ] Remove unused or redundant API files from root or old locations
- [ ] Add documentation to each API handler
- [ ] Ensure all feature slices only import what they need
- [ ] Add dynamic API routes for resource-specific operations

---

## Notes

- This approach enables modular development and easier scaling.
- If a feature grows, its `api/` folder can expand without affecting others.
- Shared logic (e.g., authentication, database) should remain in `lib/` or `utils/`.
