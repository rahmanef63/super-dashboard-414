## Plan to Make Dashboard Page Dynamic

**Objective:** Modify the dashboard page located at `src/app/dashboard/[[...slug]]/page.tsx` to dynamically render content based on dashboard and workspace IDs, incorporating static pages and dynamic pages.

**Data Structure:**

Assume a data structure similar to the following (represented as TypeScript interfaces for clarity):
```
typescript
interface Workspace {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  // ... other workspace properties
}

interface Dashboard {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  workspaces: Workspace[];
  // ... other dashboard properties
}

interface Page {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: "static" | "dynamic";
  component: React.ComponentType; // Or a way to dynamically load the component
  // ... other page properties, potentially specific to type (static/dynamic)
}

// Example Data (Illustrative, should be fetched dynamically)
const dashboards: Dashboard[] = [
  // ... 5 dashboard entries with workspaces
];

const sharedPages: Page[] = [
  { id: "settings", name: "Settings", type: "static", component: /* SettingsComponent - moved to src/shared */ null },
  { id: "static-2", name: "Profile", type: "static", component: /* ProfileComponent */ null },
  // ... other static pages
];

const dynamicPages: Page[] = [
  { id: "dynamic-1", name: "Overview", type: "dynamic", component: /* OverviewComponent */ null },
  { id: "dynamic-2", name: "Tasks", type: "dynamic", component: /* TasksComponent */ null },
  // ... other dynamic pages
];
```
**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Route Handling:**  The `[[...slug]]` route parameter in Next.js will capture the dashboard and workspace IDs.  Inside `page.tsx`, extract these IDs from the `params` object.  The expected URL structure is:

    *   `/dashboard` (root dashboard, no specific dashboard/workspace selected)
    *   `/dashboard/[dashboard_id]` (dashboard selected, no specific workspace)
    *   `/dashboard/[dashboard_id]/[workspace_id]` (dashboard and workspace selected)

2.  **Data Fetching (Simulated for now):**  Based on the extracted IDs, simulate fetching data.  In a real application, this would involve API calls to retrieve:

    *   Dashboard details (if `dashboard_id` is present)
    *   Workspace details (if `workspace_id` is present)

3.  **Menu Rendering:**  Implement a menu component that dynamically renders links based on the presence of IDs.  The menu should have two levels:

    *   **Dashboard Level:**  If `dashboard_id` is present, display links to static pages and dynamic pages relevant to the *entire dashboard* (not specific to a workspace).  This might include a "Dashboard Overview" dynamic page that isn't tied to a specific workspace.

    *   **Workspace Level:** If *both* `dashboard_id` and `workspace_id` are present, display links specific to the selected workspace. This will include static pages (which are common) and dynamic pages relevant to the *current workspace*.

4.  **Content Rendering:** Based on the route parameters, dynamically render the appropriate content area:

    *   **No ID:** Show a default dashboard overview or prompt the user to select a dashboard.
    *   **Dashboard ID only:** Show the dashboard level menu and content area with options for the entire dashboard.
    *   **Both IDs:**  Show both levels of the menu (dashboard and workspace) and render the content associated with the selected workspace. This might involve filtering `dynamicPages` to only show those applicable to workspaces.

5.  **Flexing Static and Dynamic Pages:** Ensure that static pages appear in both the dashboard and workspace menus. Dynamic pages should appear in the appropriate menu level based on whether they are associated with a dashboard generally or a specific workspace.

**Example Code Snippet (Conceptual - inside `page.tsx`):**
```
typescript
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';

export default async function DashboardPage({ params }: { params: { slug?: string[] } }) {
  const [dashboardId, workspaceId] = params.slug || [];

  // Simulated Data Fetching
  let dashboard: Dashboard | undefined = dashboards.find(d => d.id === dashboardId);
  let workspace: Workspace | undefined = dashboard?.workspaces.find(w => w.id === workspaceId);

  // Handle invalid IDs
  if (dashboardId && !dashboard) {
    notFound(); // Or redirect to a 404 page
  }
  if (workspaceId && !workspace) {
    notFound();
  }


  // Dynamic Menu Generation (Component needs to be implemented)
  const menu = (
    <DynamicMenu
      dashboardId={dashboardId}
      workspaceId={workspaceId}
      sharedPages={sharedPages}
      dynamicPages={dynamicPages}
    />
  );


  // Content Rendering
  let content;

  if (!dashboardId) {
    content = <div>Select a dashboard.</div>;
  } else if (!workspaceId) {
    content = <div>Dashboard Overview or Select a Workspace</div>; // Render a general dashboard overview or prompt to select a workspace
  } else {
    // Find and render the dynamic content for the workspace
    const workspaceContent = dynamicPages.find(p => p.id === "dynamic-1")?.component; // Example: Assuming "dynamic-1" is the default workspace page
    content = workspaceContent ? <workspaceContent /> : <div>Workspace Content Not Found</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {menu}
      <main>{content}</main>
    </div>
  );
}
```
**Key Considerations:**

*   **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling for invalid IDs and data fetching failures.
*   **Data Relationships:** Clearly define the relationship between dashboards, workspaces, and pages (especially dynamic pages) in your data model. This will impact how you filter and display pages in the menu.
*   **Dynamic Component Loading:**  Instead of directly importing components in the `Page` interface, consider using dynamic imports (`next/dynamic`) to improve performance by only loading the necessary components.
*   **Menu Component:** Create a separate `DynamicMenu` component to encapsulate the menu logic and keep `page.tsx` cleaner.  This component will handle the conditional rendering of menu items based on the presence of IDs and the relevant page data.
*   **Styling:** Apply appropriate styling to the menu and content areas to create a user-friendly interface.
*   **Accessibility:**  Ensure the dynamic menu and content are accessible, following WCAG guidelines.

This plan provides a high-level overview.  The actual implementation will require more detailed coding and consideration of your specific data structures and application requirements. Remember to handle edge cases and thoroughly test your changes.
